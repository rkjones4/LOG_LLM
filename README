To use:

Set:

PATH_TO_LOG
ORG_KEY
API_KEY

Within oai.py

Then you can make a logged LLM call like:

resp = base_query('gpt4o', YOUR_PROMPT)

If you have an image to include in the prompt, at '/path/to/img'

you can do:

image_data = oai_enc_image('/path/to/img')

resp = base_query('gpt4o', YOUR_PROMPT, image_data=image_data)

Then you can check the experimental cost with cost.py

For instance, if you have many LLM calls that are a part of a single experiment, you can automatically create an openAI log for the expriment by passing in  '/path/to/log/file' to base_query as the 'log_file' argument.

Then you can run cost.py like:

python3 cost.py exp /path/to/log/file

Otherwise you can use cost.py to check the cost for a day or month like

# Check march:
python3 cost.py day 2025_03

# Check march 14
python3 cost.py day 2025_03_14
